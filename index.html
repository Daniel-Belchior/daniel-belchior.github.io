## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Minnesota](https://cla.umn.edu/economics){:target="_blank"} and I am currently on the job market.

My field of interest is Macroeconomics, with a particular focus on Optimal Taxation, Family Economics, and International Economics.
