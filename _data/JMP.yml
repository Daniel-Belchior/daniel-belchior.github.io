  abstract: "This paper studies how income taxes should behave over the business cycle in the presence of downward rigid wages. Using the standard neoclassical general equilibrium model, we determine the optimal Ramsey taxes and find that the optimal labor income tax exhibits two separate properties: (i) the optimal labor income tax should increase when the lower bound on wages is binding. The labor market outcome is determined by labor demand, so it is possible to raise revenue without introducing additional distortions; (ii) the optimal labor income tax incorporates the fact that the lower bound for the next period depends on the current wage. Thus, a lower labor income tax to can reduce the exposure to the lower bound on the wage in the future. We also find that the optimal capital income tax exhibits similar properties, but the effects are in the reverse direction since the capital income tax is set one period in advance and influences the stock of capital of the period in which it is collected. \ We solve a numerical exercise to illustrate these properties and conclude that the optimal labor income tax behaves counter-cyclically to output, and that the optimal capital income tax behaves pro-cyclically."
